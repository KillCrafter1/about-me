# Hello world! 👋

### 👱‍♂️ About Me:

I'm Kilian from German. I am a Student & Freelance Developer and I'm currently building a Company called [Zyonic Software](https://github.com/zyonic-software/) with a some other people and friends.

If you are wondering why my personal account here is so empty, I mostly work on projects that are private or ones that are Zyonic or Herukan projects. I post here only occasionally "funny" things or smaller test projects and design ideas.

I'm currently working on a few Discord-Bots like [Herukan](https://herukan.com) (which is based on @AzraAnimating 's [Maddox](https://github.com/zyonic-software/maddox-v2/) framework) and some App and Web stuff.
