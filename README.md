## Hello world ðŸ‘‹

### About Me:

I'm Kilian from German. I am a Student & Freelance Developer and I'm currently building a Company called ([Zyonic Software](https://github.com/zyonic-software/)) with a some other people and friends.

If you are wondering why my personal account here is so empty, I mostly work on projects that are private or ones that are Zyonic or Herukan projects. I post here only occasionally "funny" things or smaller test projects and design ideas.

I'm currently working on a few Discord-Bots like [Herukan](https://herukan.com) (which is based on @AzraAnimating 's [Maddox](https://github.com/zyonic-software/maddox-v2/) framework) and some App and Web stuff.

### ðŸ‘¯ Working with me

If you need assistance in any Project involving Minecraft, Elite:Dangerous Data Collection or Discord, feel free to contact me, and I'll help you if I like your Project, providing I have time of course.

### ðŸ“« Contacting

If you want to get in touch with me (for whatever reason) just shoot me an [E-Mail](mailto:kilihbr@gmail.com) or contact me on Discord (AzraAnimating#3851).
